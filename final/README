Run [make] 
Executable name: "final"

Final Project - Vijoy Sunil Kumar
CSCI4229/5229 Summer 2018

Scene Description:
----------------- 
This is based on the Interrogation room in 'The Dark Knight' movie where Batman questions the Joker [see image: ./dk.jpg]. 
When you run [make && ./final], the default view is orthogonal (without the roof rendered) so that the entire scene is 
visible at start up. The roof gets automatically rendered when you go into first person. 
See image: ./dk.jpg to view the scene from the movie. 

Objects in scene:
-----------------
 * Room 		(walls, pillars, roof, floors)
 * Transparent window
 * Tables 		(different sizes and orientations)
 * Chairs 		(different orientations)
 * Lamps 		(different orientations)
 * Laptops 		(different orientations)
 * Human characters	(Blender objects)
 * Clock & sign boards  (Exit, warning signs)

Things to note:
-----------------
 * Blender objects 	(.obj files in ./blender)
   The human characters in the scene (batman and joker) is completely made from scratch using Blender and imported into
   the project using LoadOBJ() function. (The batman character has a cape as well). 
   NOTE: Textures have not been applied completely to the blender objects as I ran out of time. I spend a lot longer than 
   anticipated in creating the human models from scratch. (And, this was my first time using blender).

 * Collision detection 	(in first person)
   When in first person (press [m] or [M] to get to first person mode), collision detection has been added to all the 
   walls, floors and roofs. 
   NOTE: Collision detection has not been applied to the tables & chairs because it made the first person movement harder
   with all the objects around the room.

 * Texture & lighting  	(.bmp files in ./texture)
   The texture for all surfaces has been set based off of the original 'The Dark Knight' movie interrogation scene and the
   lighting has been set so that its effect is natural.
   NOTE: [&] to toggle all textures and [*] to toggle lighting 

Feedbacks & Improvements:
-----------------
 * "Nice start, but you need to improve Batman and the Joker.  They can't just be cuboids."
    - Replaced simple (boring) cuboid human figures with blender .obj objects made from scratch.
 * "Since the room is pretty empty, you need to make the few objects very detailed in order to make this worth while."
    - Added viewing rooms on either sides of the interrogation room with 3-4 objects.
